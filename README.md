  1. Fork the repo
  2. Clone it to local
  3. Install the development version of Ruby `sudo apt-get install ruby-dev`.
  4. Install nodejs `sudo apt-get install nodejs`.
  3. Install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with `gem install jekyll`. Make sure it runs Jekyll >= 2.0.
  4. Install Bundler `gem install bundler` and run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, Jekyll-Sitemap, Octopress, etc).
  5. Run it locally with `jekyll serve`. If it throws errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundler exec jekyll serve` instead.

Now that your local version of it is up and running, try to add some .md posts to *_posts*. Read the CONTRIBUTE.md to see how to write articles.

bundle update; gem install github-pages;
