Databricks recently announced [__GraphFrames__](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/03/03/introducing-graphframes.html), awesome Spark extension to implement graph processing using DataFrames.  
I performed graph analysis and visualized beautiful ball movement network of Golden State Warriors using rich data provided by [NBA.com's stats](http://stats.nba.com/)

# Pass network of Warriors
### Passes received & made

The league's MVP Stephen Curry received the most passes and the team's MVP Draymond Green provides the most passes.  
We've seen most of the offense start with their pick & roll or Curry's off-ball cuts with Green as a pass provider.

### Label Propagation

Label Propagation is an algorithm to find communities in a graph network.  
The algorithm nicely classifies players into backcourt and frontcourt without providing label!  

<table border="4" class="dataframe">  <thead>    <tr style="text-align: center;">      <th>name</th>      <th>label</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Thompson, Klay</td>      <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Barbosa, Leandro</td>      <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Curry, Stephen</td>      <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Clark, Ian</td>      <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Livingston, Shaun</td>      <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Rush, Brandon</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Green, Draymond</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Speights, Marreese</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Bogut, Andrew</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>McAdoo, James Michael</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Iguodala, Andre</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Varejao, Anderson</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Ezeli, Festus</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Looney, Kevon</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Barnes, Harrison</td>      <td>7</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>

### Pagerank

PageRank can detect important nodes (players in this case) in a network.  
It's no surprise that Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson are the top three.  
The algoritm detects Shaun Livingston and Andre Iguodala play key roles in the Warriors' passing games.  

<table border="4" class="dataframe">  <thead>    <tr style="text-align: center;">      <th>name</th>      <th>pagerank</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Curry, Stephen</td>      <td>2.17</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Green, Draymond</td>      <td>1.99</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Thompson, Klay</td>      <td>1.34</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Livingston, Shaun</td>      <td>1.29</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Iguodala, Andre</td>      <td>1.21</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Barnes, Harrison</td>      <td>0.86</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Bogut, Andrew</td>      <td>0.77</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Barbosa, Leandro</td>      <td>0.72</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Speights, Marreese</td>      <td>0.66</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Clark, Ian</td>      <td>0.59</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Rush, Brandon</td>      <td>0.57</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Ezeli, Festus</td>      <td>0.48</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>McAdoo, James Michael</td>      <td>0.27</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Varejao, Anderson</td>      <td>0.19</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Looney, Kevon</td>      <td>0.16</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>

# Workflow

## Calling API

I used the endpoint __playerdashptpass__ and saved data for all the players in the team into local JSON files.  
The data is about *who passed how many times* in 2015-16 season

# GSW player IDs
playerids = [201575,201578,2738,202691,101106,2760,2571,203949,203546,
203110,201939,203105,2733,1626172,203084]

# Calling API and store the results as JSON
for playerid in playerids:
    os.system('curl "http://stats.nba.com/stats/playerdashptpass?'
        'DateFrom=&'
        'DateTo=&'
        'GameSegment=&'

## JSON -> Panda's DataFrame

Then I combined all the individual JSON files into a single DataFrame for later aggregation.  

{% highlight python %}
raw = pd.DataFrame()
for playerid in playerids:
    with open("{playerid}.json".format(playerid=playerid)) as json_file:
        parsed = json.load(json_file)['resultSets'][0]
        raw = raw.append(
            pd.DataFrame(parsed['rowSet'], columns=parsed['headers']))

raw = raw.rename(columns={'PLAYER_NAME_LAST_FIRST': 'PLAYER'})

raw['id'] = raw['PLAYER'].str.replace(', ', '')

## Prepare vertices and edges

You need a special data format for GraphFrames in Spark, vertices and edges.  
Vertices are lis of nodes and IDs in a graph.  
Edges are the relathionship of the nodes.   
You can pass additional features like weight but I couldn't find out a way to utilize there features well in later analysis. 
A workaround I took below is brute force and not even a proper graph operation but works (suggestions/comments are very welcome).  

{% highlight python %}
# Make raw vertices
pandas_vertices = raw[['PLAYER', 'id']].drop_duplicates()
pandas_vertices.columns = ['name', 'id']

# Make raw edges
pandas_edges = pd.DataFrame()
for passer in raw['id'].drop_duplicates():
    for receiver in raw[(raw['PASS_TO'].isin(raw['PLAYER'])) &
     (raw['id'] == passer)]['PASS_TO'].drop_duplicates():
        pandas_edges = pandas_edges.append(pd.DataFrame(
        	{'passer': passer, 'receiver': receiver
        	.replace(  ', ', '')}, 
        	index=range(int(raw[(raw['id'] == passer) &
        	 (raw['PASS_TO'] == receiver)]['PASS'].values))))

pandas_edges.columns = ['src', 'dst']

{% endhighlight %}

## Graph analysis

Bring the local vertices and edges to Spark and let it spark.  

{% highlight python %}
vertices = sqlContext.createDataFrame(pandas_vertices)
edges = sqlContext.createDataFrame(pandas_edges)

# Analysis part
g = GraphFrame(vertices, edges)
print("vertices")
g.vertices.show()
print("edges")
g.edges.show()
print("inDegrees")
g.inDegrees.sort('inDegree', ascending=False).show()
print("outDegrees")
g.outDegrees.sort('outDegree', ascending=False).show()
print("degrees")
g.degrees.sort('degree', ascending=False).show()
print("labelPropagation")
g.labelPropagation(maxIter=5).show()
print("pageRank")
g.pageRank(resetProbability=0.15, tol=0.01).vertices.sort(
    'pagerank', ascending=False).show()

## Visualise the network

When you run [__gsw_passing_network.py__](https://github.com/yukiegosapporo/gsw_passing_network/blob/master/gsw_passing_network.py) in my github repo, you have *passes.csv*, *groups.csv* and *size.csv* in your working directory.  
I used *networkD3* package in R to make a cool interactive D3 chart.  

{% highlight r %}
library(networkD3)

setwd('/Users/yuki/Documents/code_for_blog/gsw_passing_network')
passes <- read.csv("passes.csv")
groups <- read.csv("groups.csv")
size <- read.csv("size.csv")

passes$source <- as.numeric(as.factor(passes$PLAYER))-1
passes$target <- as.numeric(as.factor(passes$PASS_TO))-1
passes$PASS <- passes$PASS/50

groups$nodeid <- groups$name
groups$name <- as.numeric(as.factor(groups$name))-1
groups$group <- as.numeric(as.factor(groups$label))-1
nodes <- merge(groups,size[-1],by="id")
nodes$pagerank <- nodes$pagerank^2*100


forceNetwork(Links = passes,
             Nodes = nodes,
             Source = "source",
             fontFamily = "Arial",
             colourScale = JS("d3.scale.category10()"),
             Target = "target",
             Value = "PASS",
             NodeID = "nodeid",
             Nodesize = "pagerank",
             linkDistance = 350,
             Group = "group", 
             opacity = 0.8,
             fontSize = 16,
             zoom = TRUE,
             opacityNoHover = TRUE)
